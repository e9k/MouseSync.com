# ReyonMouseFix
A mousefix that greatly improves aim by quantization
This is a mousefix that is revolutionary.

your mouse actually has a irrational gain of something 3.xxxx which is irrational number. 
THerefor you actually struggle to memorize this gain. If you calibrate the mouse so that 1cm movement equals some ratio you have a physically based sensitivity which your brain automatically registers as intuitive due to million of years of hand eye coordination..
There are also other improvements embedded such as a reverse engineered WMO algorithm that emulates the feeling of having a WMO on any mice, that rawness factor

I have alot of improvements like constant latency, the idea behind is that it doesnt matter the latency aslong as its a constant you increase accuracy. Most mice jitter their latency like crazy

**CHAT EXCERPS**

what they call linear is not linear, its only linear mathematically like DX + a   
the gain can be anything 3.2626 its still considered linear because the movement is directly correlated. 
Just badly. Your brain has million of years of calibration if you give the unit it expects, the mouse becomes measurably better.


Oke lets say i have a apple, i say move the apple 3 apples wide to the right.
Now do the same but i say move the apple 3.1436262 to the right


A mouse works in any fraction, but does your brain too?
its really not a computer problem, its a user problem

especially on Spheres because imagine this. if you move i.e 3.2632 radians across the circumfrence of the sphere, 
how often do you end up in the same spot? 
Now imagine if you take a 1 degree at a time, you will end up in 360 times, everytime.

so the video shows, i snap 180 to a completely new object

MouseDPI is DPI of the mouse
Polling rate: Does nothing for now
Resolution X is autofilled ( change this with the games resolution if you play full screen e.g 1280x1024)
Resolution Y is autofilled ( change this with the games resolution if you play full screen e.g 1280x1024)
Physical Screen X is the width of your monitor in millimeter
Physical Screen Y is the height of your monitor in millimeter
Extra Scale X is Sensitivity, Recommended to try it out but keep it in integer ratios like 12,3 or 0.5, 0.333 etc
Extra Scale Y is Sensitivity, Recommended to try it out but keep it in integer ratios like 12,3 or 0.5, 0.333 etc
