>Okay so program seemed safe enough, data being sent out seems non-malicious, so I tried it. Not gonna lie, it might just be placebo, but I definitely feel more consistent and smoother already, though the mouse feel has noticeably changed and I can't tell if there's input lag or whether this is just a result of the quantization.

>Here's a quick clip from bounce 180 that I hit with this driver interceptor. I'd say this is the nicest b180 clip I've ever gotten by a little bit, seems like I can move at quicker speeds without losing as much smoothness and precision. Using GPW @ 37cm/360 on cordura mouse pad. I have the X/Y scaling set to 10 for each, also.
